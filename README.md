# TaijiRandomizer

Randomizer mod for the game Taiji.

## Installation

1. Download the [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases) installer.
2. Run the MelonLoader installer. It will ask you for the Unity Game to modify. Find Taiji.exe and select it. Unless you put it somewhere else, it is likely `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Taiji\Taiji.exe`. Leave the version and architecture as the default.
3. Open up Taiji, let the MelonLoader patcher run fully, until the game actually loads, at which point you can close it again.
4. Put `TaijiRandomizer.dll` in the Mods folder in your Taiji installation, and run Taiji again.
